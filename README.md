# Python Runner (Developed in VB6)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Python Runner! This project is an application developed in Visual Basic 6 (VB6) designed to provide a simple and efficient interface for running Python scripts and helping users manage their Python code.

## Project Background

With the widespread adoption of Python, more and more developers need a convenient tool to run and manage their Python code. We developed this Python Runner to simplify this process, allowing users to more easily run Python scripts, view output results, and manage their code.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to get started quickly.
- **Run Python Scripts**: Supports executing local Python files and displaying output results.
- **Code Management**: Provides functionality to save code libraries and automatically save the currently edited Python file.
- **Error Reporting**: When a script encounters an error, detailed error information is provided to help users quickly identify the issue.
- **Multi-Version Support**: Allows configuration to use different versions of the Python interpreter, flexibly accommodating different project needs.

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have the VB6 runtime environment installed on your computer.
2. Download the source code or zip file for this project.
3. Open the project file using the VB6 IDE and compile it to generate the executable file.
4. Make sure that Python is installed on your system (recommended version is Python 3.x).

## Usage Instructions

1. Launch the Python Runner.
2. Write or paste your Python code.
3. Click the "Run" button to execute the code and view the output.
